this project dates on 16-10-2025.


this is the code for a 12th standard science project
of a "miniconsole" using a 1.8 inch TFT colour display
along with a joystick and a mpu6050 tilt sensor to make 
a mobile device.

excess and unusable components such as an speaker amplifier
and a unsuitable battery were used making it so that 
the device is very bad at doing most of the things it is 
supposed to.


component list-
• Slide switch.
• Li-Po cell (3.7v 1800mah)
• TP4056 Charging Module(blue colour type-c)
• 5V Voltage Regulator Module(with on 1000μF capacitor,
green colour small)
• ST7735-s Display Module (resolution:128x160) 1.8 inch
• PAM8403 Audio Amplifier Module(green colour)
• 2x 2W laptop speakers
• CD4051 Multiplexer Module(with a 100μF capacitor)
• NodeMCU Microcontroller Development Board(SoC
ESP8266 with integrated Wi-Fi, black colour, with 100μF
capacitor)
• Joystick Module
• MPU6050 accelerometer gyro 3 axis sensor(blue colour,
attached on the right side behind the VeroBoard)
• Veroboard (green colour connection board used to make
circuits)
• 470 ohm resistor (between NodeMCU audio output and
amplifier audio input)
• 3 Million kilometers of connection wires, jk.

Other Connections-
• both speakers on the same audio amplifier output
• battery to switch to charging module’s battery input
• charging module output to 5V voltage regulator module.
• Regulator module output to amplifier, multiplexer, joystick,
display and NodeMCU power inputs.(means Vo of regulator
to every where where it says Vcc or VIN or 5v on the board.
• Sensor power is from NodeMCU 3V and GND pins.
• All capacitors in parallel to outputs and inputs of regulator
module, multiplexer and NodeMCU.

from the given code in "main.cpp" file, replace the wifi and password
as well as the other user details with the one that are wanted by the user.

the device projects its own website on the local network-

http://miniconsole.local/

most of the code for this was written using AI LLMs and AI Agents.
while some minor iterations were made directly.
